# Writing good documentation

## Headers with `#`

If you want to add a cool title, subtitle, or just subheaders that delimit a clear break on topic, you can use the `#` operator. If you see the raw version of this document, you will see that this title has a `#` and subsequent headers start to shrink with the addition of `#`'s.

Try it out yourself. Create a markdown file:

```bash
touch test.md
```

After that, insert these lines and check the preview:

```
# Biggest header

## Kinda big

### Getting smaller

#### and smaller

##### reaching the limit

###### limit is six #'s
```
